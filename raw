# Dedication {.unlisted .unnumbered}

This cookbook is dedicated to Vanessa Lynn Baril who inspired me with her baking and cooking from a young age. I grew up with a peanut allergy in the late 1990s and early 2000s where there was little in the way of "peanut free" foods. My lovely mother Vanessa was constantly hard at work in the kitchen making home-cooked meals, baking and desserts for me, including making nut free cakes for events and birthdays. She was always inventing ways to make peanut free versions of foods so I would not feel left out at events and birthday parties. Vanessa also worked hard to educate herself friends, family members and educators about my peanut allergy and how to keep me safe.

## Moist Chocolate Cake & Frosting

### Cole Baril {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Ingredients**

Cake:

\begin{multicols}{2}

• 1¾ cups all purpose flour

• 2 cups granulated white sugar

• 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

• 1½ tsp. baking soda

• ¾ tsp. salt

• 2 large eggs

• 1 cup buttermilk 

• 1/2 cup butter melted

• 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract

• 1 cup hot coffee

\end{multicols}

Frosting:

• 340g dark/bittersweet chocolate 60-70% cocoa, chopped

• 227g unsalted butter room temperature

• 1/4 cup cocoa powder either natural or dutch process are fine

• 1/2 cup icing sugar

• A pinch salt

• 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract

• 1/4 cup whipping cream

> *See next page for methods.*

\pagebreak

**Methods**

Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Grease and flour two 9-inch baking pans (or line with parchment paper circles) and set aside.
2. In the large bowl of a standing mixer, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt on low speed for one minute.
3. Add eggs, buttermilk, melted butter and vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until batter forms, about 30 seconds. Pause to scrape down sides and bottom of mixer bowl as well as the paddle. Beat 15 seconds more, until mixture is mostly smooth.
4. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in hot coffee with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very runny.
5. Pour batter evenly between the two pans and bake on middle rack of oven for 25-35 minutes, until thermometer inserted in the middle reaches 190ºF.
6. Allow to cool 15 minutes in pans, then run a butter knife around the edges of each cake. Line two cooling racks with parchment paper. (See note)
7. Place a cooling rack over top of each pan. Wearing oven mitts, use both hands to hold the racks in place while flipping the cakes over onto the racks. Set the racks down and gently thump on the bottom of the pans until the cakes release. Cool completely before handling or frosting.

Frosting:

1. Melt the chocolate in the microwave on 50% power in 30 second increments, stirring each time - stop when it's about 70% melted, and stir vigorously to melt the rest. In my microwave, it took a total of 2 1/2 minutes. (Alternatively, melt in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water - careful not to get a single drop of water in the bowl, or chocolate will seize). Allow chocolate to cool to room temperature.
2. Combine butter, cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until well combined, about a minute. Reduce speed to low and incorporate vanilla extract, whipping cream and cooled chocolate, then turn speed back up to medium and beat for about 5 minutes, until pale and very fluffy. Pipe (I used Wilton Large Open Star tip) or spread onto fully cooled cake or cupcakes.
3. Frosting may be made up to 48 hours in advance - refrigerate until needed, then bring back to room temperature and beat again for a minute or two before using. Frosted cake may be stored at room temperature for up to two days - if it'll take you longer to eat, god bless your willpower and store the cake in the fridge.
